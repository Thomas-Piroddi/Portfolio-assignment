        <p>I am currently enrolled in the Sydney campus CoderAcademy. I am 22 years of age and currently live with my family in Maroubra. I am a pretty keen sports enthusiast and try to keep my lifestyle as active as possible. I play rugby outside of my class time and enjoy frequent exercise with my dog. My goal for this semester is to become as adaptable and independent as possible with my code writing so that I can continue to tackle the course challenges head on.</p>

        <p>I had virtually zero coding experience before undertaking this course apart from the suggested pre-course work.</p>

    <div class="body_text">
        <p>I attended Newington college in Stanmore from year 7-12 and completed my studies there in 2015. I went on to enrol in a Bachelor of Science at the University of Sydney majoring in metabolism and nutrition. I was not too satisfied with my degree and felt myself struggling to take my studies seriously so I opted to defer for a year and work full-time. This gave me a lengthy breathing space where I could reassess what I actually wanted to do. I found myself drawn to coding and this day I havenâ€™t looked back!</p>
